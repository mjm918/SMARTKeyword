# SMARTKeyword
Haven't optimized yet (Work pending)

# Goal
To create a java library that can be used in android and other platforms. Work is on hold. Most of the features are 
implemented already but not `optimized` yet. The main goal is to simplify the searching fundtions in android apps.
It also helps to generate `keywords` based on the word frequencies from any content or article. It follows the standard formula
where it ignores verb, adverd and other not important words. 

# Features
* search any keyword <- string array (ok)
* search only keyword <- string array (ok)
* search indexes of keyword <- single line string (ok)
* search in file and return suggested line based on keyword <- file (ok)
* search only keyword in single string <- single line string (ok)
* search any keyword in single string <- single line string (ok)
* generate keywords from file <- file (ok)
* generate keyword from string <- single line string (pending)
* generate keywords from string array <- string array (pending)
